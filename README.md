# Coding a Python Module to Analyze, Visualize and Track Google Trends Data
<p align="justify">Launched in 2006, Google Trends, provides users with invaluable insights into how people search on the world’s most popular search engine. The vast amount of searches — trillions take place every year — make Google Trends one of the world’s largest real time datasets. Examining what people search for provides a unique perspective on what they are currently interested in and curious about. Researchers have used Google Trends data to investigate a number of questions, from exploring the course of influenza outbreaks to forecasting economic indicators. The kinds of searches that users perform can be a good proxy for the public’s interests, concerns or intentions, but these searches do not necessarily represent users’ opinions and therefore the data can be used to track industry/market traction. This project leverages the data that can be found on Google Trends through a Python library called pytrends to explore, document and visualise search interest in specific places over a set time frame. Various visualisation techniques are used to create global and country specific choropleth maps, interactive time series line graphs and animated heat maps to display search term trend patterns. Finally, through object-oriented programming, the code is packaged together to form a module that can be utilized by anyone interested in this project.</p>
